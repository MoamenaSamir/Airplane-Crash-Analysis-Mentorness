# Airplane Crash Analysis using Power BI

## PURPOSE
Analyze airplane crashes (1980-2023) using Power BI for interactive visualizations.

## OBJECTIVES
- Temporal and geospatial analysis of airplane crashes.
- Analysis of operator and aircraft performance.
- Fatality trends in airplane crashes.
- Route analysis to identify patterns in crash occurrences.

## KEY FEATURES OR COMPONENTS
- Dataset includes crash details and information on fatalities.

## TARGET AUDIENCE OR BENEFICIARIES
Airplane companies seeking insights to enhance aviation safety.

## METHODOLOGY OR APPROACH
1. **Import the Data**: Import the dataset as a CSV file.
2. **Data Transformation and Cleaning**:
   - Remove empty values.
   - Change data types as necessary.
   - Replace inconsistent values.
   - Rename columns for clarity.
3. **Visualize the Data**: Utilize Power BI for creating interactive visualizations.

## RESULTS
- Chicago O'Hare, Illinois, especially along route (Chicago, IL - Los Angeles, CA), has the highest airplane fatality rate in the world.
- The year 2001 had the highest airplane fatalities rate globally.
- There is a relationship between the aircraft registration details (N110AA), AC Type (McDonnell Douglas DC-10-10), and the number of fatalities.
- There is a relationship between the operator American Airlines with serial number (46510/22) and the number of fatalities.

## EXPECTED OUTCOMES
Enhance aviation safety by providing actionable insights from the analysis of airplane crash data.
