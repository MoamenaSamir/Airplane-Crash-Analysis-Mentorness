# Airplane Crash Analysis Using Power BI

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to analyze airplane crashes that occurred between 1980 and 2023 using Power BI for creating interactive visualizations.

## Objectives
1. Perform temporal and geospatial analysis of airplane crashes.
2. Analyze operator and aircraft performance based on crash data.
3. Identify trends in fatalities related to airplane crashes.
4. Conduct route analysis to uncover patterns in crash occurrences.

## Key Features or Components
- Dataset includes comprehensive crash details and information on fatalities.

## Target Audience or Beneficiaries
Airplane companies seeking insights to enhance aviation safety measures.

## Methodology or Approach
1. **Import the Data:** Import the dataset as a CSV file.
2. **Data Transformation and Cleaning:**
   - Remove empty values.
   - Adjust data types as necessary.
   - Standardize inconsistent values.
   - Rename columns for clarity.
3. **Visualize the Data:** Utilize Power BI for creating interactive visualizations to explore the data comprehensively.

## Results
- Identified Chicago O'Hare, Illinois, particularly along the route to Los Angeles, CA, as having the highest airplane fatality rate globally.
- Highlighted the year 2001 with the highest global airplane fatality rate.
- Established relationships between specific aircraft registrations (e.g., N110AA), aircraft types (e.g., McDonnell Douglas DC-10-10), and the number of fatalities.
- Identified correlations between specific operators (e.g., American Airlines) and the occurrence of fatalities based on their aircraft.

## Expected Outcomes
This project aims to enhance aviation safety by providing actionable insights derived from the analysis of airplane crash data. These insights will assist airplane companies in implementing targeted measures to improve safety protocols and operational practices.
