**Project Summary: Analyzing Airplane Crashes (1980-2023) Using Power BI**

**Purpose:** 
The purpose of this project is to analyze airplane crashes spanning from 1980 to 2023 using Power BI for interactive visualizations.

**Objectives:**
1. Conduct temporal and geospatial analysis of airplane crashes.
2. Analyze operator and aircraft performance based on crash data.
3. Identify trends in fatalities related to airplane crashes.
4. Perform route analysis to uncover patterns in crash occurrences.

**Key Features or Components:**
- Dataset includes comprehensive crash details and information on fatalities.
  
**Target Audience or Beneficiaries:**
- Airplane companies aiming to gain insights to enhance aviation safety measures.

**Methodology or Approach:**
1. **Data Import:** Import the dataset in CSV format.
2. **Data Transformation and Cleaning:**
   - Remove empty values from the dataset.
   - Adjust data types as necessary for analysis.
   - Standardize inconsistent values.
   - Rename columns to improve clarity and understanding.
3. **Data Visualization:** Utilize Power BI to create interactive visualizations for comprehensive data exploration.

**Results:**
- Identified Chicago O'Hare, Illinois, particularly along the route to Los Angeles, CA, as having the highest airplane fatality rate globally.
- Highlighted the year 2001 with the highest global airplane fatality rate.
- Established relationships between specific aircraft registrations (e.g., N110AA) and aircraft types (e.g., McDonnell Douglas DC-10-10) with the number of fatalities.
- Identified correlations between specific operators (e.g., American Airlines) and the occurrence of fatalities based on their aircraft.

**Expected Outcomes:**
The project aims to enhance aviation safety by providing actionable insights derived from the analysis of airplane crash data. These insights will help airplane companies implement targeted measures to improve safety protocols and operational practices.
